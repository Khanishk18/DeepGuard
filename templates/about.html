<h1 class="title">About DeepGuard</h1>
<p class="lead">
  DeepGuard is a multimodal deepfake detection platform that analyzes <b>images</b> and <b>audio</b> using deep learning.
  We combine <b>CNN-based vision</b> with <b>Mel-spectrogram audio modeling</b> to identify synthetic artifacts and cross-modal inconsistencies.

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to restore trust in digital media by offering a fast, accurate, and accessible detector that empowers
    journalists, platforms, and everyday users to verify content authenticity before sharing or acting on it.
    DeepGuard is built for extensibility: video, lip-sync alignment, and adversarial robustness are on our roadmap.

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li><b>Visual:</b> Preprocessing + MobileNetV2 learns manipulation cues like unnatural edges, textures, and lighting.</li>
    <li><b>Audio:</b> We convert speech to Mel-spectrograms and train a CNN to detect synthetic frequency/time patterns.</li>
    <li><b>Inference:</b> Unified interface returns a label (Real/Fake) with a confidence bar for clarity.</li>
  </ul>
